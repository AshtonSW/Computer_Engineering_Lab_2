- Course number: CSE3016
# Course Overview
- I gained the ability to design and implement digital circuits on an FPGA 
based on the theory of digital logic circuits and confirmed their operation.

#1. Project: Based on the theory learned in the "Introduction to Digital Circuits" class, 
I implemented the logic through experiments/practical exercises and verified that it operates correctly. 
I prepared for the experiments and checked the results by writing weekly preliminary and final reports.

#2. Presentation: I gave a presentation on the theory and experimental/practical exercise contents related to counters.
